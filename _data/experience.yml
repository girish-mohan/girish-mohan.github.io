    Worked at the Spectrum Lab, under the guidance of [Dr. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula](https://sites.google.com/site/chandrasekharseelamantula/), 
    on Sparse Independent Component Analysis for source separation in Neural Signals. During my time 
    at the lab I implemented ICA algorithms on the dataset and analysed the differences in the 
    independent components obtained. I also had the chance to participate in 
    [BCL 2019](https://www.iisc.ac.in/events/bcl-2019-third-workshop-on-brain-computation-and-learning/)
    workshop which helped me consolidate my interests.
