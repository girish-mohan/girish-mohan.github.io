    Majored in Information Technology with a minor in Computational Mathematics and 
a bag full of experience in organising and managing college fests to technical development

    While at Manipal I spent a lot of my free time with the Cycling society. I spent two years 
    on the committee as a treasurer. During this time I initiated a Cyclothon event which has 
    then gone on to become an annual event in Manipal.
