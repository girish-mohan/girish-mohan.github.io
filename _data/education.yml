  description: |
    Senior year undergraduate student, majoring in Information Technology, with a CGPA of 8.38 and 
    a bag full of experience in organising and managing college fests to technical developments 
    through working in teams like SolarMobil and the Editorial Board. 

    While at Manipal I spent a lot of my free time with the Cycling society. I spent two years 
    on the committee as a treasurer. During this time I initiated a Cyclothon event which has 
    then gone on to become an annual event in Manipal.
